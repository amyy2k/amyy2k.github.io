        <h3>iOS Application</h3>
        <p class="full-description">
          This mock application enables users to discover restaurants that best cater to their tastes, using special filters to find niche accommodations. Initially brainstormed in Figma, the application was subsequently developed using Swift for iOS.

        <h3>Raspberry Pi Music Mixer</h3>
        <p class="full-description">
          This project demonstrates the use of a matrix keypad to create sounds and display images with a click of the pad. Developed with a Raspberry Pi 4, it combines various hardware components and custom coding. Most of the code was written from scratch, building on basic keypad entry functionality. The result is a basic music mixer that allows users to create their own music, maintaining a consistent 90 BPM (beats per minute). With 12 different audio loops, users can craft unique tracks and tunes. This project showcases the potential of using the Raspberry Pi for music creation.

        <h3>Vending Machine Database</h3>
        <p class="full-description">
          This project was focused on exploring MySQL. We developed a Vending Machine Management System that tracks inventory, sales, and the status of all vending machines. The system provides easy access to this information, facilitating efficient restocking schedules. The application was built using Python and integrated with MySQL.
